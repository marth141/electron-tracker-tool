## Resources
Built off this: https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate

## Description
This tool was built after a request from some CAD Supervisors to build some way for designers to track their work and stats. One major need was for instaneous updating so React was decided on for this purpose.

Currently there is still more work to be done on the application after starting off the boilerplate. A timer is going to be added for helping designers watch how long they have been working on a particular account while the designer's errors can be displayed to them along with a list and record of the designers worked accounts and time taken.
